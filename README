It seems like a good idea to check an email addresses domain for a valid MX record before atempting to send an email to it.
Domain name look ups are slow and most email is sent to a few domains like, gmail, yahoo,msn,aol, etc.
So caching seems like a good way to speed it up checking for valid MX records.
